# Welcome to CodigoDelSur Java tech challenge

To set up the app you will need Java 17 on your environment. You will also need an API testing platform (we recommend Postman but you are free to use any platform of your choice)

## Setup instructions
- Run `./gradlew build`
- Run `java -jar build/libs/challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- In the API platform make a GET request to http://localhost:8080 to confirm the server is running
